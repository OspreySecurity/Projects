Souffle -
	Souffle is an app that allows users to combine multiple cloud drives
into a single location. The program will manage the location of each item 
uploaded, and to the user everything will appear to be in the same location
(i.e. a single drive). It will connect via apis to each cloud server, and then 
store the oauth keys to be used later.

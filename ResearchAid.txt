ResearchAid (It currently doesn't have a name) Is a website to bring research together. The idea is that instead of everyone doing their own reasearch, and then putting it on the shelf once they move onto the next topic, we allow them to store, and even mark up their research. When a user reads a book, he will make a annotated "cover sheet" of each chapter. This sheet will include favorite quotes, a summary, and even several tags pointing to this chapter. When they complete the book (or even a portion of the book) they are allowed to make a combined sheet (called a vignette) of the book, or section. After several books, they will have a built in set of links to each book as the tags collide. They will then be able to search other user's research, and search links made by them. As the total web becomes more and more complete we will develope groups for each book, and create "master" cover sheets, and even vingnettes. People will be able to compare these master sheets with those of other users, and even their own, and suggest changes. By connecting all this research, a new user will be able to find dozens, or even hundreds of different locations where this topic is discussed in literature. They will be able to guide their research towards more productive locations, and eliminate much of their wasted time on false leads.

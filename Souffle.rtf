\f0\fs24 \cf0 Souffle -\
	Souffle is an app that allows users to combine multiple cloud drives into a single location. The program will manage the location of each item uploaded, and to the user everything will appear to be in the same location (i.e. a single drive). It will connect via apis to each cloud server, and then store the oauth keys to be used later.}
